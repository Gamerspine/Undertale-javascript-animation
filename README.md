# Undertale-themed-Javascript-site
A Javascript site based on Undertale

As a Javascript school project I created this sites based on the Undertale game replicating some of the animation while narrating a part of the game lore.<br><br>
Library used:<br>
<a href="https://jquery.com/">JQuery</a><br>
<a href="https://blaiprat.github.io/jquery.animateSprite/">jquery.animateSprite</a><br><br>
At the moment the site isn't responsive. For the intended experience is better use a screen with the resolution 1920x1080 or using the inspect tool of the browser and change the display size.
